## Acknowledgments
No one does it alone. The author has a great support from friends, colleagues
and two wonderful women.

## Foreword
Practical Vim is presented under "tips" format. "Tips" help you solve things,
but not make you feel like Vim master. Should see this book's approach as
problem/solution.

## Read Me
"...in the hands of an expert, Vim shreds text at the speed of thought..."
Vim is available everywhere, from a remote server over SSH or local instance of
GVim.
Powerful tool.
**How This Book is Structured**
Is a recipe book. NOT to read from start to finish.
Some tips are self contained, many are cross-referenced.
Novice might prefer read the early tips of each chapter.
Advanced reader might choose to focus on the later tips or move around the book
as needed.
**A Note on the Examples**
In Vim, there's always more than one way to complete any given task.
So try to find a resemblance of the solution in this book to our real life
problems.
**Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim**
If not the benefits of learning Vim wouldn't come fast.
Vim is developed from classic Unix editors like *vi* and *ed*, these predate
the mouse and point-and-click interface.

## Read the Forgotten Manual
**Get to know Vim's Built-in Documentation**
**Playing melodies**
Using keyboard with Vim is much like playing on the piano keyboard.
We can play one note.
A sequence. Or a Chord.
**Use Vim's Factory Settings**
$ vim -u NONE -N
"- NONE" means not to source vimrc
"- N" means set nocompatible
Specify vimrc file:
$ vim -u code/essential.vim
**On the Role of Vim Script**
It's huge, so the book doesn't want to cover it all.
**On Vim Versions**

GUI or TUI doesn't matter anyway.
