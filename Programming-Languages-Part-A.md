#Programming Languages - Part A
From: https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/home/welcome
Professor: Dan Grossman from University of Washington

##Overview 

What:

- Introduction to basic concept of programming languages
- Emphasis on functional programming

- How any languages "fit together"
- -> make learners effective in programming / learning new languages

- many languages -> thinking deeply about how to use language, and write elegant programs
- functional programming -> robust, composeble programs


Goals:

- Accurately understands FP and OOP
- Skill to learn new languages
- Master language concepts `like, the main points of language?`
- Evaluate power and elegance of a language
- Reasonable efficient in ML, Racket and Ruby

I will have fun learning to think in a new way


### Approximate List of Specific Course Topics

Mark every line by hand

Part A:

- Syntax vs. semantics vs. idioms vs. libraries vs. tools
- ML basics (bindings, conditionals, records, functions)
- Recursive functions and recursive types
- Benefits of no mutation
- Algebraic datatypes, pattern matching
- Tail recursion
- Higher-order functions; closures
- Lexical scope
- Currying
- Syntactic sugar
- Equivalence and effects
- Parametric polymorphism and container types
- Type inference
- Abstract types and modules

Part B:

- Racket basics
- Dynamic vs. static typing
- Laziness, streams, and memoization
- Implementing languages, especially higher-order functions
- Macros
- Eval

Part C:

- Ruby basics
- Object-oriented programming is dynamic dispatch
- Pure object-orientation
- Implementing dynamic dispatch
- Multiple inheritance, interfaces, and mixins
- OOP vs. functional decomposition and extensibility
- Subtyping for records, functions, and objects
- Class-based subtyping
- Subtyping
- Subtyping vs. parametric polymorphism; bounded polymorphism
