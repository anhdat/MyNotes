 This is the new note

# A headline
Content of the first head line should be very very long to make a suitable line
break, since it still short, I will write some more.

## Another headline
This is the content of sub-headline and should contains a list with it:
• And I create a List to demonstration something
• This is another thing that makes sense
• TODO todo not so readable
• DONE is quite simple
• XXX seem nothing

### Also a headline

To get started enter a title for your note above. When you’re ready to save
your note just use Vim’s :write or :update commands, a filename will be picked
automatically based on the title.

                                    * * *

The notes plug-in comes with self hosting documentation. To jump to these notes
