# Foreword

• Watch The Karate Kid.
• Daniel wants to learn karate.
• Miyagi gives a lot of exercises.
• Have to drill.

# Glasgow Haskell Compiler

• Leading implementation of Haskell. 
• Comprises compiler and interpreter.

# Standard Prelude

• Along with math functions, Haskell provides functions on list;
> head [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> 1
>
> tail  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>  [2, 3, 4, 5]
>
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] !! 2 “ not a constant time action
> 3 “ hardly use because it’s still an imperative thinking
>
> take 
>
> drop
>
> length “time linear
>
> sum
>
> product 
>
> “ append two lists
> [1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5]
>
> reverse [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>
 
# Fucntion Application

• Function application is denoted using white space.
> f a b + c*d
• Function application has higher priority than any other operator
> f a + b “ means f applied to a then plus b
> f x “ f(x)
> f x y “ f(x, y)
> f (g x) “ f(g(x)) 
> f x (g y) “ f(x, g(x))
> f x * g y “ f(x)g(y)

# Haskell as script

• .hs is not mandatory
• Two windows open: one to write, one to run GHCi

# Naming Requirements

• Function and argument names must begin with a lower case letter.
> myFun fun1 arg_2
• List arguments usually has a s suffix on their name.
> xs ns nss

# Layout Rule

• White space is significant.
• Layout rule to avoid the need for explicit syntax to indicate the grouping of
definition.

# Useful GHCi Commands

• :load name
• :reload
• :edit name
• :edit
• :type expr “ show type of expr
• :? “ show all commands
• :quit
